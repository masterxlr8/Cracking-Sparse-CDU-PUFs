## Cracking-Sparse-CDU-PUFs
CS771 Course Project

# The repo contains codes for:
1. Solving LASSO using Coordinate Descent
2. Projected Gradient Descent with Correction
3. Proximal Gradient Descent with Nesterov's Accelerated Gradient (NAG)

Proximal Gradient Descent with NAG gave the least error of about 3x10^-7 on validation data.
The report file contains mathematical proof for existence of a sparse linear solution to the given problem, performance of our program and explanation on how we tuned the hyperparameters.
